    <p>
    LeBron takes flight on wings of flame,
A king in motion, proud of name.
With court-wide grace and iron will,
He bends the game, then bends it still.</p>
<p>
From Cleveland nights to Lakers' gold,
His legend grows, forever bold.
A pass, a dunk, a chase-down blockâ€”
Each moment carves his name in rock.
</p>
<p>
Not just in stats, but how he leads,
In every heart, his story breeds.
So here we cheer, with rightful praise:
LeBron, a king for all our days.
    </p>
