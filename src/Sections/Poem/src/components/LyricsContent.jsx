        Blackbird <span>singing</span> in the dead of night<br />
        Take these sunken eyes and <span>learn</span> to see<br />
        All your life<br />
        You were only waiting for this <span>moment</span> to be free<br />
        Blackbird fly, blackbird fly<br />
        Into the light of a <span>dark</span> black night<br />
        Blackbird fly, blackbird fly<br />
        Into the light of a dark <span>black</span> night<br />
        Blackbird <span>singing</span> in the dead of night<br />
